# This is a comment.

print("This is not a comment.")

# As I was saying... with a hash at the start of writing you can write a comment.
# If you stack them you can write multiple lines like this.

print(":)")  # You can use comment to write "in line" with code too.

"""
This is also comment, in this case this is a multiline comment!

Code comments allow us to write onto .py files (or basically any programming language) without 
affecting code functionality.

Comments are also known to be part of "documentation". As our code becomes evermore complex, 
maintaining some form of written explanation is essential to allowing other developers to read and 
understand our code. Even if our projects are private, comments are a good idea since after some 
time even we might forget how our own code works.

'''
You can also use triple single quotations for multi line comments, up to developer preference. The 
important part of documentation is STAY CONSISTENT! I personally prefer double quotations so this 
is just for example use.

# TODO: This is a TODO comment. Basically it act as a note that something has to be done later.
