"""
Now that we've covered some of the most basic datatypes we can cover some of the different basic 
operations we can conduct with different values.
"""

# ---------- Mathematical Operators ----------------------------------------------------------------
x = 5
y = 2

print(x + y)  # Addition, prints "7".
print(x - y)  # Subtraction, prints "3".
print(x * y)  # Multiplication, prints "10".
print(x / y)  # Division, prints "2.5".
print(x ** y)  # Exponential, x^y, prints "25".
print(x // y)  # Integer division, prints "2".
print(x % y)  # Modulus, returns the division remainder, prints "1".

"""
x = x + y ... is the same as ... x += y
x = x - y ... is the same as ... x -= y
x = x * y ... is the same as ... x *= y
x = x / y ... is the same as ... x /= y
"""

# ---------- Bitwise Operators ---------------------------------------------------------------------


# ---------- Logical Operators ---------------------------------------------------------------------

print(1 == 2)  #
print(2 == 2)  # Equal value, prints True.
print(2 != 2)  # Unequal value, prints False.

These operators can then be put together using the following key words
